# cljbox2d

2D physics engine.

A [clojure](http://clojure.org/) wrapper for
[JBox2D](http://www.jbox2d.org/), which is a close Java port of Erin
Catto's excellent C++ [Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/) physics engine.

This is my first clojure project. Feedback would be appreciated.

## API docs

See http://floybix.github.com/cljbox2d/

## Usage

Get [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) first.

Some ports of the Box2D / JBox2D testbed tests:

<pre>
lein run -m cljbox2d.tests.blob
lein run -m cljbox2d.tests.collision-processing
lein run -m cljbox2d.tests.sensor-test
lein run -m cljbox2d.tests.edge-points
...etc...
</pre>

See the ball bounce (requires some imagination...)

```clojure
(use 'cljbox2d.core)
(create-world!)
(def ground (body! {:type :static}
                   {:shape (edge [-40 0] [40 0])}))
(def ball (body! {:position [0 10]}
                 {:shape (circle 1), :restitution 0.5}))
;; let it go
(dotimes [i 10]
  (println (position ball))
  (step! (/ 1 3)))
