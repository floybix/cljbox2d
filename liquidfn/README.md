# liquidfn

2D physics engine.

A [clojure](http://clojure.org/) wrapper for
[LiquidFun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/), which is based on
[Box2D](http://www.box2d.org/).

So far this only wraps the Javascript lib!

Java via SWIG remains a (not too pleasant) possibility.

## Examples

They can be run from source using Leiningen as:
